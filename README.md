# OpenCV-Face-And-Eye-Detection-In-Flask-Web-Framework

Welcome to the OpenCV-Face-And-Eye-Detection-In-Flask-Web-Framework project!

This project showcases how to integrate face and eye detection using OpenCV into a Flask web application. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that allows for various image and video processing tasks, including object detection. Flask, on the other hand, is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.

In this project, we have used the Haar Cascades classifier, which is a machine learning-based approach to object detection. The classifier is trained to detect specific objects, such as faces or eyes, based on a set of features. The features are determined by analyzing a large number of positive and negative images.

The project includes a simple Flask web application that allows users to upload an image and detect faces and eyes in the image. The detected objects are then highlighted with bounding boxes.

This project is intended for anyone interested in learning how to integrate OpenCV object detection into a Flask web application. The code is well-documented, and there are comments throughout the code to help you understand how everything works.

We hope you find this project useful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
